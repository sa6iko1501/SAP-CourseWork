# SAP-CourseWork
  Project I recieved from the company SAP due to high performance on a mid-semester test. The goal of the project was to write a simple monolithic app that does the function
of a TV cable company. Technologies used include Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Spring, MySQL. The application offers basic user functions like buying channels for a 3, 6, 12, 18 
and 24 month periods and changing personal info like username, e_mail, password, phone number. The admin functions include adding channel providers, creating/deleting/editing channels, deleting users and seeing their info and contracts that 
they have with the company.
 

  Before running the Application create a MySQL database with the desired name and connect it to the project. Please run the TestInnitialization test before starting the program. This will fill up the database with test data. There will be two user profiles one of which as both the 
'ADMIN' and 'USER' roles with username "admin1" and password "admin123" and the second one which has only the 'USER' role with the username "user1" and password "user123".
To access the admin functions go to the 'user' page and click on the 'admin page' button. The user1 profile only has the abbility to buy channels
